# Product Hunt Alert - [link](http://producthuntalert.com)
### get a text when your domain is mentioned on Product Hunt

```bash

$ git clone https://github.com/jessepollak/phalert.git
$ npm install

```

To contribute to the landing page, checkout the `gh-pages` branch.

### TODO

Right now, [Product Hunt Alert](http://producthuntalert.com) only supports mentions of a domain in the submitted products for a day. Ideally, we'd like to expand that support to mentions in the comments for each product. 

PRs are very much appreciated!
